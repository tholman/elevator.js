# elevator.js
Finally, a "back to top" button that behaves like a real elevator, by adding elevator music to quietly soothe the awkwardness that can ensue when being smoothly scrolled to the top of the screen.

This is very serious stuff, [here's a demo](http://tholman.com/elevator.js)!

### Instructions

`Elevator.js` is a stand alone library (no jquery, or the likes) so usage is pretty straight forward. All styling of elements is up to you. `Elevator.js` only handles the audio management, and the scroll functionality!

#### JS

`Elevator.js` lives entirely within the js realm, which makes things fairly simple to use.

You'll need to create a new instance of `Elevator`, and pass it some audio elements.
```html
<script>
// Elevator script included on the page, already.

window.onload = function() {
  var elevator = new Elevator({
    mainAudio: '/src/to/audio.mp3',
    endAudio: '/src/to/end-audio.mp3'
  });
}

// You can run the elevator, by calling.
elevator.elevate();
</script>
```

You can also add an "element" option, clicking this element will invoke the "Scroll to top" functionality, we all love and crave.
```html
<div class="elevator-button">Back to Top</div>

<script>
// Elevator script included on the page, already.

window.onload = function() {
  var elevator = new Elevator({
    element: document.querySelector('.elevator-button'),
    mainAudio: '/src/to/audio.mp3',
    endAudio: '/src/to/end-audio.mp3'
  });
}
</script>
```

If you're really serious (boring), you can disable the audio by setting `mainAudio` and `endAudio` to `false`. You can also set a fixed time to scroll to the top
```html
<div class="elevator-button">Back to Top</div>

<script>
// Elevator script included on the page, already.

window.onload = function() {
  var elevator = new Elevator({
    element: document.querySelector('.elevator-button'),
    duration: 1000 // milliseconds
    mainAudio: false,
    endAudio: false
  });
}
</script>
```
